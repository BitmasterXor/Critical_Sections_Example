# Delphi Multithreading Example (Making use of Critical Sections)

This Delphi VCL application demonstrates multithreading using two threads that compete to update a UI with progress bars and labels.

## Features
- Two threads updating four progress bars simultaneously.
- Use of `TCriticalSection` to ensure thread safety.
- UI updates synchronized with `TThread.Synchronize`.

## How It Works
- The application starts two threads when the button is clicked.
- Each thread attempts to update the progress bars and label.
- The progress bars increment by 5 until they reach 100.
- The application ensures that only one thread can update the UI at a time using a critical section.
- Once both threads are finished, the button is re-enabled.
